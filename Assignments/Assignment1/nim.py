'''
The game of Nim. This is a well-known game with a number of variants. The following variant has an interesting
winning strategy. Two players alternately take marbles from a pile. In each move, a player chooses
how many marbles to take. The player must take at least one but at most half of the marbles. Then the other 
player takes a turn. The player who takes the last marble loses. //
Write a program in which the computer plays against a human opponent. Generate a random integer
between 10 and 100 to denote the initial size of the pile. Generate a random integer between 0 and 1 
to decide whether the computer or the human takes the frst turn. Generate a random integer between 0 and 1 
to decide whether the computer plays smart or stupid. In stupid mode the computer simply takes a random
legal value (between 1 and n/2) from the pile whenever it has a turn. In smart mode the computer takes 
off enough marbles to make the size of the pile a power of two minus 1â€”that is, 3, 7, 15, 31, or 63. 
That is always a legal move, except when the size of the pile is currently one less than a power of two. 
In that case, the computer makes a random legal move.
You will note that the computer cannot be beaten in smart mode when it has the frst move,
unless the pile size happens to be 15, 31, or 63. Of course, a human player who has the frst turn 
and knows the winning strategy can win against the computer.

    The function allows the computer to make smart moves and dumb moves at random. Dumb moves are when the computer
    takes marbles at random legal quantities, while smart moves are when the computer uses the logarithmic formula below to calculate how many
    marbles to take so that it leaves the optimal number of marbles for the computer to win. The human is free to make his/her choices as long
    as the move is legal.
